## Calculator

It's a simple calculator made in Visual Studio 2022 using C# with Windows Forms. 

- That project made me a little familiar with something using C# without being in the console. It was kinda cool to made.

## Notes:
- Honestly, i did not like Windows Forms much because it does not allow the dev to make things with a good design. 
- Besides that, i felt kinda confusing to use it and im almost certain that i will not use it again. I searched out for anything that could fit my desire for design and found that Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) could do that.
